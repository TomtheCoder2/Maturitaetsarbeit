\section{Objective}\label{sec:objective}

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine that can effectively compete with a human in foosball.
More specifically, the machine should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Defend against balls traveling at speeds of up to $7m/s$.
    This is approximately the speed achieved by normal players when they try to shoot fast.
    \item Shoot the ball back with a speed of $7m/s$.
    \item Achieve a positional precision of $1mm$, which is circa the accuracy of normal stepper motors (including the mechanics to move the players).
\end{itemize}

\section{Motors}\label{sec:motors}

\subsection{Objectives}\label{subsec:objectives}
The goalkeeper should be able to defend a ball with a velocity of maximum $v_{max}=7m/s$.

This picture shows the table with the measurements:

        \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
%\todo{The calculations dont make completly sense, i think i made a mistake somewhere and bought an overpowered motor, which is fine i guess}

\subsection{Calculations for the moving motor}\label{subsec:moving_motor}
The distance from the foremost attacker to the goal is $s=0.4m$.
That means the player has to stop the ball in time $t_s$, where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stopping_time}
    t_s = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{0.4m}{7m/s} \approx 0.057 s.
\end{equation}
Which is not a lot of time to process the image and move the motors.
I round the travel distance of the goalkeeper from $180mm$ to $200mm$ for the calculations because there is a spring at either end which can be compressed.
I always keep the goalkeeper in the middle, such that the player has to travel a maximum distance of $0.1m$.
That means the player has an average velocity of
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:average_velocity}
    \bar{v} = \frac{s}{t_s} = \frac{0.1m}{0.057s} \approx 1.75m/s.
\end{equation}
I assume a constant acceleration and deceleration, so when the player reaches the top speed it needs to decelerate immediately, to keep the forces as low as possible.
A graph to explain the velocity can be seen here:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \centering
        \begin{axis}
            [
            axis x line=center,
            axis y line=center,
            width={0.2\linewidth},
            xtick=none,
            ytick={0,1},
            yticklabels={,$v_{max}$},
            xlabel={$t$},
            ylabel={$v$},
            xlabel style={below right},
            ylabel style={above left},
            xmin=-0.2,
            xmax=2.2,
            ymin=-0.2,
            ymax=1.2]

            \addplot [] table {
                0 0
                1 1
                2 0
            };
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Which means the player has a top speed of $v_{max}=2\cdot1.75m/s=3.5m/s$.
The motor also needs to be able to accelerate the player in $0.057s/2=0.0285$, which means the motor needs to be able to achieve a maximum acceleration $a_{max}$ of
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:acceleration}
    a_{max} = \frac{v_{max}}{t_s} = \frac{3.5m/s}{0.0285s} = 122.8m/s^2.
\end{equation}
I assume that the weight of the tubes is $m \approx 0.1kg$.
The torque needed to move the tubes is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:torque}
    \tau = F \cdot r = m \cdot a \cdot r = 0.1kg \cdot 122.8m/s^2 \cdot 0.083m \approx 1Nm
\end{equation}
assuming the radius $r_g$ of the gear is 8.3cm and the required top rotational speed (measured in rotations per minute $\text{RPM}$) is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:top_rpm}
    \frac{v}{2\pi r_g} \cdot 60s/min = \frac{7m/s}{2\pi \cdot 0.083m} \cdot 60s/min \approx 800\text{RPM}.
\end{equation}
A motor that fits those requirements is the \textbf{PD42-3-1141\autocite{PD42-3-1141}} from \textbf{Trinamic}.

\subsection{Calculations for the shooting motor}\label{subsec:rotating_motor}
The ball has a mass $m=17g$.
I assume that I have an angle of $45\deg$ ($=\frac{\pi}{4}$ in radians) to accelerate the ball.

    }

    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \def \r {2cm}

        \def \angle {45}

        \pic[rotate=-45/2,transform shape] at (0,0) {testpic2};
        \draw (0,0) -- ({-sin(\angle / 2)*\r}, {-cos(\angle / 2)*\r});
        \draw (0,0) -- ({sin(\angle / 2)*\r}, {-cos(\angle / 2)*\r}) node[right, midway] {$r_p=70\text{mm}$};
        \draw ({-sin(\angle / 2)*\rsmall}, {-cos(\angle / 2)*\rsmall}) arc(270-\angle/2:270+\angle/2:\rsmall) node[midway,below] {$45\deg$};
        \draw[->] ({-sin(\angle / 2)*\r}, {-cos(\angle / 2)*\r}) arc(270-\angle/2:270+\angle/2:\r) node[midway,below] {$l$};
%        \draw () circle (\r);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
%    \\
That means the player has the distance $l$ (arc length) to accelerate the ball together with the player.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:distance}
    l = r_p \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = 70mm \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = 55mm
\end{equation}
The goal is to shoot the ball back at a speed of $7m/s$.
The time to make one full rotation with the given speed of $7m/s$ is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:time}
    t_{rot} = \frac{2\pi\cdot r_p}{v} = \frac{2\pi\cdot 70mm}{7m/s} = \frac{\pi}{50} \approx 0.06s
\end{equation}
The maximum speed can easily be calculated with
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:max_speed}
    \omega = \frac{60s/min}{t_{rot}} = \frac{60s/min}{0.6s/rotation} = 1000\text{RPM}
\end{equation}
\todo{Compute the torque needed to accelerate the ball}
For the motor that just rotates the figure I can use a DC motor with gears and an encoder, as they often have more power and can go faster with less torque and accuracy.

\section{Camera}\label{sec:camera}

\subsection{Optics}\label{subsec:lens}
To achieve my goal of defending against balls at speed of up to $7m/s$, I need a camera that can capture the entire table at a framerate of at least 200fps.
I record the table from the bottom to avoid seeing the players and the rods instead of the ball; therefore, I have to replace the floor of the table with a glass plate.
A sensor that achieves this is the \textbf{IMX287 CMOS} sensor from \textbf{Sony}.
This sensor has a width of $w=4.98\text{mm}$.
Here is a schematic of the approximate setup for the camera:\\
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) -- (0, 5);
        \draw (0, 5) -- (10, 5);
        \draw (10, 5) -- (10, 0);

        \draw (1,0) -- (1, 4);
        \draw[red] (1, 4) -- (9, 4) node[pos=0.8, below] {Glass plate};
        \draw (9, 4) -- (9, 0);

        \draw (4.5, 0) -- (5.5, 0) node[below] {Sensor (4.98mm)};

        \pgfmathsetmacro{\lensRadius}{1}
        \pgfmathsetmacro{\lensHeight}{0.5}
        \pgfmathsetmacro{\startAngle}{asin(\lensHeight/\lensRadius)}

        \draw [fill=blue!15]  (4.5,\lensHeight)
        arc[start angle=180-\startAngle+90,delta angle=2*\startAngle,radius=\lensRadius]
        arc[start angle=-\startAngle+90,delta angle=2*\startAngle,radius=\lensRadius]
        -- cycle; % to get a better line end

        \draw[blue] (1, 4) -- (4.5, \lensHeight);
        \draw[blue] (4.5, \lensHeight) -- (5.5, 0);

        \draw[blue] (9, 4) -- (5.5, \lensHeight);
        \draw[blue] (5.5, \lensHeight) -- (4.5, 0);

        \draw[green] (1, 4) -- (5.5, \lensHeight);
        \draw[green] (5.5, \lensHeight) -- (5.5, 0);

        \draw[green] (9, 4) -- (4.5, \lensHeight);
        \draw[green] (4.5, \lensHeight) -- (4.5, 0);

        \draw (6.5, 0.5) node[]{Lens};
        \draw[<->] (5, 0.70) -- (5, 4) node[midway, right] {d};
        \draw[<->] (1, 4.2) -- (9, 4.2) node[above, midway] {Field of View (FoV)=Length of the foosball field};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Lens Equation}\label{par:lens_equation}

The relationship between the FoV, the focal length $f$, the sensor width $w$, and the distance to the object $d$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \text{FoV} = \text{w} \cdot \frac{\text{d}}{\text{f}}\label{eq:lens_equation}
\end{equation}


\noindent In my case $d = 700mm$ and my Field of View is $1200mm$ as this is the length of the foosball field.
Now I solve for the focal length $f$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:focal_length}
    f = \frac{\text{w} \cdot \text{d}}{\text{FoV}} = \frac{4.98\text{mm} \times 700\text{mm}}{1200\text{mm}} \approx 2.9\text{mm}
\end{equation}

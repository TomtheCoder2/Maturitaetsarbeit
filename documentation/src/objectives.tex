\section{Objective}\label{sec:objective}

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robotic goalkeeper capable of competing effectively with human players in foosball.
This project serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of building such a machine with high performance and precision.
Specifically, the robotic goalkeeper should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Defend against balls traveling at speeds of up to $7\text{m/s}$, matching the typical speeds achieved by skilled players during fast shots.
    \item Return the ball with a shooting speed of $7\text{m/s}$.
    \item Achieve a positional accuracy of $1\text{mm}$, comparable to the precision of standard stepper motors, including the mechanical components for player movement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objective}\label{sec:objective}

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robotic goalkeeper capable of competing effectively with human players in foosball.
This project serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility of building such a machine with high performance and precision.
Specifically, the robotic goalkeeper should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Defend against balls traveling at speeds of up to $\qty[per-mode=symbol]{7}{\m\per\s}$, matching the typical speeds achieved by skilled players during fast shots.
    \item Return the ball with a shooting speed of $\qty[per-mode=symbol]{7}{\m\per\s}$.
    \item Achieve a positional accuracy of $\qty[per-mode=symbol]{1}{\mm}$, comparable to the precision of standard stepper motors, including the mechanical components for player movement.
\end{itemize}

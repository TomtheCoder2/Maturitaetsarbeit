# todos
- determine the actual speed in mm/s
- increase stepping mode to 1/16 or 1/32 as we could do like 1e5 steps per second
- implement acceleration and deceleration
- make real limits for the motor with the help of the ltc values
- add homing function
- calculate speed in mm/s not steps/s or delay in us
- create a calibration script to determine the steps per mm
- maybe use the board which came with the stepper motor
